## BEFORE SUBMITTING!

*  _**I will be grading the latest version of your master branch on GitHub, commits not on master will not be factored into the grade.**_ 
Your code needs to be runnable from the project's root directory on Onyx, adherent to the command line usage stated in the handout, **DO NOT PUT PACKAGE STATEMENTS IN YOUR CODE**. When I go to grade your project, I will clone a copy via ssh. You will we need to create a GitHub, Onyx key pair to do this cloning yourself if you want to test your code under the same conditions I will be grading it. Follow these instructions to do that: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent, The components done in a terminal should be done on Onyx.

*  For this project, I (Jonathan Porter) am willing to be available by Slack, Discord, or a chat room of your preference.

## TIPS FROM PREVIOUS SEMESTERS

The groups who got the highest grades and finished the fastest in the previous semesters have done the following:

* Had at least one member go to each tutoring session until they finished the project, the more members who came, the better it was for the group. 
    * It is strongly encouraged to come to tutoring in person. It will be easier for me to help with debugging, and easier to get my attention.
    * If you work on the project only during tutoring hours, you will likely not finish.
* Wrote testing scripts for their BTree class (not required).
    * Tests written followed the given, when, then format.
    * Test cases should vary in complexity. Considered basic cases like filling a root until it's full, to more complex cases like splitting an internal node, and a root with children. 
    * What b-tree degree do you think would be good for testing b-tree functionality?
* Worked on Java classes in parallel whenever possible. (Example: One member write the driver while the other two work on implementing and testing the BTree class)
* Prioritized passing diff check on dump files.
* Used IDEs with built in version control tools like VS Code or Intellij.
